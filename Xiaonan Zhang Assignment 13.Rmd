>**I would like to thank you for your lectures. I really learned a lot from this course. Can't imagine I never used R four months agao and now I rely on it so much. This course is a really good start for me. Now I'm confident in doing research analysis by independet studies. I really appreciate your help, Dr. Seaman! **
